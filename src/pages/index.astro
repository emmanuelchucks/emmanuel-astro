          I enjoy building things that solve problems and spark joy. I'm
          currently working on a social platform to help connect event planners
          and celebrants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes I play the piano to help me relax and meditate. I love
          reading about design and development to stay up to date with the
          latest technologies.
