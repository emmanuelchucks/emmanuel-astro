import Demo from 'components/Demo.astro'
import { ReactToggle } from './ReactToggle.tsx'

First off, the thing we all love about React:

```ts
export function Toggle() {
  const [on, setOn] = useState(false)
  return <button onClick={() => setOn(!on)}>{on ? 'on' : 'off'}</button>
}
```

<Demo>
  <ReactToggle client:visible />
</Demo>
